helps students look at how their studies are going,
An NCEA helper bot - that scans the Ncea website and looks at your neca level and where are you at and then it forms an outcome to help the student, to tell them where they are and how they are doing in their Ncea

It can use an API of an open source or free ai model, that uses selenium, (ai model)
To read the page source and then the gen ai looks at the source of the page and then gives the results back in a feedback format - here is an i have made example:  


Uses: selenium/google.generative/ai
Then selenium opens chrome and the users logs in and in 
Terminal the user clicks enter after the user has logged in 
and has gone to the results page and then it fetches results and creates an file and displays 
them in the Terminal/ the created file then uses system.os(f’say “{results}”’)
