#Study Bot App


NCEA Helper Bot A machine that analyzes results and gives students feedback on their progress through NCEA.

How Does This Work: The bot scrapes the official NCEA site, obtains the student’s current NCEA level and progress and provide a personalized progress report. In it, Selenium is used to automate the web, and an open-source AI model (like Google Generative AI) that scrapes the data and generates insights.

How It Runs: Selenium opens up Chrome to let the user log in. The user logs in and from the results page, presses Enter in the terminal. The bot retrieves the results, creates a structured feedback file, and then shows important findings in the command line. The feedback file uses os. Add system(f'say "{results}"') to read the results out loud if you want.

First Segment: Selenium (To automate a Chrome browser) Google Generative AI (free AI model) Python (os module)
