 # Study Bot App ðŸš€


 ## NCEA Helper Bot
A machine that analyzes results and givesâ€‚students feedback on their progress through NCEA.

 ## How Does This Work: 
The bot scrapes the official NCEA site, obtains the studentâ€™s current NCEA level and progress and provide aâ€‚personalized progress report. In it, Seleniumâ€‚is used to automate the web, and an open-source AI model (like Google Generative AI) that scrapes the data and generates insights.

## How It Runs:
Selenium opens up Chromeâ€‚to let the user log in. The userâ€‚logs in and from the results page, presses Enter in the terminal. The bot retrieves the results, creates a structured feedback file, and then shows important findings in theâ€‚command line. The feedback file uses os. Add system(f'say "{results}"') to read the results out loudâ€‚if you want.
